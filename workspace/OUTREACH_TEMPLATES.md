# Contractor Outreach Templates

**Objective:** Get 10 real contractors to test the beta
**Success metric:** At least 3 complete the OAuth verification flow

---

## Target Audience

**Ideal beta testers:**
1. **Freelance developers** on LinkedIn/Twitter who:
   - Recently posted about client work
   - Have active GitHub profiles
   - Mention "contractor" or "freelance" in bio

2. **Agency contractors** who:
   - Work with multiple clients
   - Have compliance/verification pain points
   - Are in regulated industries (finance, healthcare)

3. **International contractors** who:
   - Work with US clients
   - Face extra verification hurdles
   - Mention visa/remote work challenges

---

## Template 1: LinkedIn DM (Problem-First)

**Subject:** Background checks taking 6+ weeks?

**Message:**
```
Hey [Name] 👋

Saw your post about [recent project/client work]. Quick question:

Have you ever had a contract delayed because background checks took weeks?

I built something that might help - speeds up contractor verification from 6 weeks to 24h using verified digital signals (GitHub/LinkedIn OAuth + provisional credentials).

Free beta - would you test it and give feedback?

Takes <5 min: [YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE]

No catch, just want to validate if this solves a real pain point.

— Claude
```

**Why this works:**
- Opens with their pain point
- Shows you did research (mentioned their post)
- Clear value prop: "6 weeks → 24h"
- Low commitment: "5 min test"
- Transparent: "just validating"

---

## Template 2: Twitter/X DM (Curiosity Hook)

**Message:**
```
saw you're freelancing [niche] 👀

built a tool that cuts contractor verification time from weeks → 24h

free beta, need honest feedback

interested? dm me or try: [YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE]

(no sales pitch, just validating demand)
```

**Why this works:**
- Short and scannable (Twitter users skim)
- Curiosity: "weeks → 24h" is bold claim
- Permission-based: "interested?"
- No BS: "no sales pitch"

---

## Template 3: Email (For Warm Leads)

**Subject:** Contractor verification beta (need your feedback)

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm building a tool to solve a problem I keep hearing about from contractors:

**Problem:** Getting verified for new contracts takes 6+ weeks (background checks, references, identity docs). Kills momentum when you land a project.

**Solution:** Contractor Passport - issues provisional credentials in 24h based on verified digital signals:
- GitHub OAuth (proves developer identity)
- LinkedIn OAuth (proves professional history)
- Checkr integration (coming week 2)

**I need your help:**
Would you test the beta and tell me:
1. Is this actually useful?
2. Would you pay $249 to speed up verification by 5+ weeks?
3. What's missing?

Try it: [YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE]
Takes 5 minutes. Zero cost. I'll send you $25 for your feedback (seriously).

Thanks,
Claude

---
PS: If background checks aren't a pain point for you, feel free to ignore - just trying to validate demand.
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows you understand the problem deeply
- Concrete value prop: "$249 to save 5+ weeks"
- Incentivized: "$25 for feedback"
- Easy out: "ignore if not relevant"

---

## Template 4: LinkedIn Post (Public Signal)

**Post:**
```
Contractors: How long do background checks + reference verification usually take for new clients?

I'm hearing "6+ weeks" a lot. Built a tool to cut that to 24h using verified digital signals (GitHub/LinkedIn OAuth).

Free beta - testing if this solves a real problem: [YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE]

(Honest feedback wanted, not pitching anything)

#freelance #contractors #backgroundchecks
```

**Why this works:**
- Asks a question (drives engagement)
- Public proof you're building
- Hashtags target right audience
- Low pressure: "testing if this solves a problem"

---

## Template 5: Developer Community (Hacker News, Reddit r/freelance)

**Title:** Show HN: Contractor Passport - 24h background checks via verified digital signals

**Post:**
```
I built a tool to speed up contractor verification from 6 weeks to 24 hours.

**The Problem:**
Every time contractors start with a new client, they need:
- Background checks (Checkr, Onfido): 2-6 weeks
- Reference verification: 1-2 weeks
- Identity docs: 3-5 days

This kills momentum when you land a project.

**The Solution:**
Issue provisional credentials based on verified signals:
- GitHub OAuth (proves developer identity)
- LinkedIn OAuth (proves work history)
- 24h expiry, upgradeable to full clearance

**Beta Status:**
- GitHub/LinkedIn OAuth: live
- Background checks: week 2
- References: week 3

Try it: [YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE]

Honest feedback wanted: Is this useful? Would you pay $249? What's missing?

---
Tech Stack: TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, React, RSA signing
Open to questions about architecture/security.
```

**Why this works:**
- HN loves "Show HN" posts from builders
- Technical details for credibility
- Transparent about beta status
- Invites technical discussion

---

## Template 6: Cold LinkedIn Message (Personalized)

**Message:**
```
Hey [Name],

Noticed you do [specific type of work, e.g., "fintech consulting"] where clients probably need background checks.

Random question: How long does verification usually take when you start with a new client?

I built something that might help (speeds up background checks from weeks to 24h), but only want to share if it's actually relevant to your workflow.

Worth 2 min to explain?

— Claude
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows you researched their profile
- Asks permission before pitching
- Frames as "might help" not "you need this"
- Low commitment: "2 min to explain"

---

## Follow-Up Templates

### If they don't respond (3 days later):

**Message:**
```
No worries if not interested! Just wanted to close the loop:

If background checks ever become a bottleneck, I built this: [YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE]

Free beta, happy to comp you if you test it.

Either way, good luck with [their current project] 🚀
```

### If they sign up but don't complete OAuth:

**Email:**
```
Subject: Stuck on OAuth verification?

Hey [Name],

Saw you started onboarding but didn't complete the GitHub/LinkedIn verification.

Was something confusing? Or just not valuable enough?

Would love feedback - even if it's "this is useless" 😅

Let me know if I can help,
Claude
```

## Outreach Strategy

### Week 1: Manual Outreach (10 DMs)

**Target:** 10 contractors via LinkedIn DMs
- Use Template 1 (Problem-First)
- Personalize first sentence
- Send Monday-Wednesday (higher response rates)

**Expected Results:**
- 40% open rate (4/10)
- 20% reply rate (2/10)
- 10% sign-up rate (1/10)

### Week 2: Public Post + Community

**LinkedIn Post:** Template 4 (Public Signal)
**HN Post:** Template 5 (Show HN)

**Expected Results:**
- 10-20 sign-ups from public posts
- 5-10 high-quality feedback comments

### Week 3: Follow-Ups + Referrals

**Follow up with users who:**
- Signed up but didn't verify → Template 6 (Follow-up)
- Completed verification → Ask for referral: "Know 2 other contractors who'd benefit?"

---

## Measuring Success

### Metrics to Track

**Top of Funnel:**
- [ ] Messages sent: 10
- [ ] Reply rate: __% (target: 20%)
- [ ] Sign-ups: __% (target: 10%)

- [ ] Onboarding completed: __% (target: 80%)
- [ ] GitHub OAuth completed: __% (target: 60%)
- [ ] LinkedIn OAuth completed: __% (target: 40%)

**Bottom of Funnel:**
- [ ] Credentials issued: __
- [ ] Credentials verified by "employer": __
- [ ] Referrals: __

**Qualitative Feedback:**
- [ ] Is this useful? (Y/N)
- [ ] Would pay $249? (Y/N)
- [ ] What's missing? (open-ended)

---

## When to Pivot

**Red flags that demand doesn't exist:**

1. **<10% reply rate to DMs**
   - **Interpretation:** Message isn't resonating
   - **Action:** Try Template 2 (Twitter curiosity hook)

2. **People sign up but don't complete OAuth**
   - **Interpretation:** OAuth flow is too complicated or not valuable enough
   - **Action:** Simplify onboarding or add clearer value explanation

3. **People complete OAuth but say "this isn't useful"**
   - **Interpretation:** Wrong problem or wrong solution
   - **Action:** Deep dive interview - what would make this useful?

4. **Everyone says "I'd use this if it was free"**
   - **Interpretation:** Not a strong enough pain point to pay for
   - **Action:** Pivot to different problem or add more value

**Green lights that demand exists:**

1. **>20% reply rate to DMs**
2. **>50% complete OAuth after signing up**
3. **Users ask "when is background check integration ready?"**
4. **Users refer other contractors unprompted**
5. **Users ask about pricing before trying**

## Pro Tips

1. **Personalize the first sentence** - shows you're not spamming
2. **Keep it under 100 words** - respect their time
3. **One clear call-to-action** - don't give them 3 options
4. **Send Monday-Wednesday** - higher response rates than Thu-Fri
5. **Follow up once, then stop** - don't be annoying
6. **Offer incentive for feedback** - "$25 gift card for 15 min call"
7. **Be transparent about beta** - don't oversell
8. **Screenshot bugs they report** - shows you care
9. **Thank everyone who tries it** - even if feedback is negative
10. **Ship fast based on feedback** - show you're listening

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't:** Spam 100 people with generic message
✅ **Do:** Personalize 10 messages to ideal customers

❌ **Don't:** Oversell features that don't exist yet
✅ **Do:** Be honest about beta limitations

❌ **Don't:** Argue with negative feedback
✅ **Do:** Ask follow-up questions to understand the "why"

❌ **Don't:** Ghost users after they sign up
✅ **Do:** Follow up within 24h if they have issues

❌ **Don't:** Wait for "perfect product" before outreach
✅ **Do:** Ship now, iterate based on real feedback

---

## Emergency Pivots

**If after 10 DMs nobody cares:**

**Option A: Different Audience**
- Try agencies instead of individual contractors
- Try HR departments who hire contractors
- Try staffing firms who verify contractors

**Option B: Different Problem**
- Instead of "speed up verification", pitch "portable reputation"
- Instead of targeting contractors, target employers
- Instead of B2B2C (us → contractor → employer), go B2B (us → employer)

**Option C: Different Solution**
- Instead of provisional credentials, do "verification pre-approval"
- Instead of 24h credentials, do "same-day background checks"
- Instead of OAuth signals, do "reference network graph"

---

## Final Checklist

Before sending any outreach:

- [ ] Product is live and working
- [ ] OAuth flows tested end-to-end
- [ ] Privacy Policy + Terms of Service published
- [ ] Error monitoring (Sentry) enabled
- [ ] You can respond to bugs within 24h
- [ ] You have 30 min/day for user interviews
- [ ] You're mentally prepared for "this is useless" feedback
- [ ] You have a plan for what to build next based on feedback

**Remember:** The goal isn't to get users. It's to learn if this problem is worth solving.

🚀 **Good luck!**
