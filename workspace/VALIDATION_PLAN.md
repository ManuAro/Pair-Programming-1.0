# 48-Hour Validation Plan — Contractor Reputation Passport

**Objective:** Validate real demand without deployment by driving targeted outreach to a lightweight landing page.

## Hypotheses
1. **Hiring teams feel acute pain** with international contractor verification delays.
2. **They will opt in** to a pilot if it promises 24h provisional clearance + 7–10 day full verification.
3. **Contractors will opt in** to a reusable passport if it reduces repeated checks.

## Assets
- `workspace/src/landing.html` (single-page landing)
- `workspace/src/outreach_dms.md` (5 DM templates)

## Success Criteria (48h)
**Pass:**
- ≥6 company emails captured (≈30% of 20 outbound DMs)
- ≥3 positive replies asking for pilot details

**Fail (pivot/kill):**
- <3 company emails captured
- 0 positive replies

## Target List (20 total)
- 12 fintech/healthtech hiring managers or CTOs
- 4 compliance/risk leaders
- 2 recruiters/talent ops
- 2 senior contractors (control group)

## Day 1 (Today)
1. Deploy `landing.html` quickly (Netlify/Render or simple static host).
2. Send 10 DMs + 5 emails using templates.
3. Track replies and clicks (manual log).

## Day 2 (Tomorrow)
1. Send remaining 5 DMs + follow-ups to non-responders.
2. Book 2–3 short calls if positive responses appear.
3. Summarize outcomes and decide: continue, refine, or pivot.

## Tracking
Create a simple log (spreadsheet or notes):
- Name / Role / Company
- Channel (DM/Email)
- Date sent
- Response (Y/N)
- Interest level (Cold / Warm / Hot)
- Next step

## Notes
- Focus on **regulated** industries first: fintech, healthtech, government-adjacent.
- Ask for specific feedback on **pricing** and **time-to-clearance**.
- If replies indicate confusion, adjust copy and resend within 24h.
