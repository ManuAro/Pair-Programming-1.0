# Contractor Reputation Passport - Executive Summary
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED - Ready to build MVP

---

## THE PROBLEM

**International contractor verification takes 8-30 days and costs $50K-$250K per mis-hire.**

- 38% of international resumes have unverifiable history
- Fintech/healthtech companies lose deals waiting for compliance clearance
- Contractors can't reuse verification → repeat delay with every new employer
- No solution combines speed + portability + skill verification

---

## THE SOLUTION

**Contractor Reputation Passport:** One-time verification that contractors own and reuse.

**Value Prop:** Hire verified contractors in 24h (provisional) instead of 6 weeks (traditional)

**How it works:**
1. Contractor gets verified once (identity + background + skills + references)
2. Receives cryptographically-signed portable passport (valid 12 months)
3. Employers verify instantly via URL + public API
4. Provisional start in 24h, full clearance in 7-10 days

---

## MARKET VALIDATION

✅ **Pain Point:** 8-30 day delays documented; $50K-$250K losses per mis-hire
✅ **Market Size:** $5.1B (US background checks) + $20B (remote work services)
✅ **Growth:** 8-12% CAGR, 76M freelancers in US, 57% of companies hiring more remote
✅ **Competitive Gap:** No portable passport model exists
✅ **Regulatory:** Compliance requirements create pain; privacy laws favor our model

**Decision:** 🟢 GO

## BUSINESS MODEL

### Pricing
- **$249/verification** (pay-per-use)
- **$2,499/month** (15 verifications included, $149 additional)
- **50% pilot discount** for first 20 companies

### Revenue Model
- **Primary:** Companies pay for verification
- **Secondary:** Contractors get passport free (via employer) or $99 (self-service)
- **Strategy:** Demand-first (sell to companies, contractors benefit)

---

## WEDGE STRATEGY

**Target:** Fintech/healthtech companies with compliance requirements hiring remote contractors

**Why this wedge:**
- Acute pain (compliance + speed pressure)
- Budget authority (compliance is cost of doing business)
- Clear ROI ($249 vs $50K-$250K loss + 3-6 week delay)
- Regulatory moat (compliance-ready from day 1)

---

## NEXT STEPS (PATH A - Recommended)

### Week 1-2: Build & Launch Landing Page
- HTML/CSS/JS + Netlify/Vercel
- Dual lead capture (companies primary, contractors secondary)
- Deploy to contractorpassport.com

### Week 2-3: Drive Traffic
- LinkedIn outreach to fintech/healthtech hiring managers (target 100)
- Post on HN, IndieHackers, r/forhire
- Measure: Page views, form submissions, pilot requests

### Week 3-4: Validate Demand
- **Success:** ≥30 company signups OR ≥5 pilot requests → Build full MVP
- **Pivot:** <10 company leads → Revisit messaging or wedge

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| KYC providers slow (5-30 days) | Promise "provisional 24h + full clearance 7-10 days" |
| Chicken-and-egg adoption | Demand-first: sell to companies, contractors get free passport |
| Pricing resistance | Value prop: $249 passport reused 10x = $25/use vs $50/check each time |
| Fraud/gaming | Cryptographic signatures, public verification API, audit logs |

---

## METRICS TO WATCH

**Landing Page (Week 1-2):**
- 30+ company form submissions = Strong demand
- 5+ pilot requests = Validated willingness to pay
- 100+ contractor signups = Secondary market interest

**MVP (if validated):**
- Time to provisional approval (<24h)
- Time to full clearance (<10 days)
- Passport reuse rate (target: 3+ employers per passport)
- Customer acquisition cost vs lifetime value

## THE OPPORTUNITY

This isn't a feature. It's infrastructure for global talent mobility.

If we execute:
- **Year 1:** 100 companies, 1,000 contractors, $250K revenue
- **Year 3:** Standard for remote hiring in regulated industries
- **Year 5:** Platform effect (network value grows with each passport issued)

The research validates the problem is real, large, and growing. The solution is technically feasible. The business model is clear.

**Time to build.**
