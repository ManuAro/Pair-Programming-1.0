# Outreach DMs (Contractor Reputation Passport)

## 1) LinkedIn DM — Fintech/Healthtech CTO
Hi [Name] — quick question. We keep seeing fintech/healthtech teams lose weeks waiting on international contractor background checks. We built a portable “Contractor Reputation Passport” so contractors verify once and you can hire in 24h (full clearance 7–10 days). Are you hiring global contractors this quarter? If yes, I can share the pilot details (50% off for first 20 teams).

## 2) LinkedIn DM — Head of Compliance / Risk
Hi [Name], I’m testing a new compliance workflow for global contractors. Today a single background check can take 8–30 business days. We built a reusable, cryptographically signed passport (KYC/AML + identity + references) so employers verify instantly and start provisionally in 24h. Would you be open to a 10‑minute call to pressure-test this? We’re offering a pilot discount for regulated teams.

Subject: 24h contractor clearance for regulated teams

Hi [Name],

We’re launching a Contractor Reputation Passport for fintech/healthtech teams. Contractors verify once; employers get instant verification and can start them in 24h (full clearance in 7–10 days). It cuts weeks of compliance delay without losing KYC/AML rigor.

Would a pilot like this be useful for your hiring pipeline? If yes, I can send details.

— [Your Name]

## 4) LinkedIn DM — Recruiter / Talent Ops
Hi [Name] — I’m running a 48h test for a new contractor verification product. It reduces international background check delays from weeks to 24h provisional clearance. If you hire remote contractors in regulated industries, would you be open to sharing how long verification takes today? Happy to share pilot access if it’s relevant.

## 5) Contractor DM — Senior Engineer / Designer
Hi [Name] — we’re building a Contractor Reputation Passport so you can verify once and reuse it across employers. It means faster starts (24h provisional) and less repeated paperwork. Would you want early access? If yes, I can add you to the waitlist.
