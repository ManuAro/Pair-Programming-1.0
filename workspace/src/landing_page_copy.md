## PROBLEM SECTION

### Headline
**The hiring tax killing your momentum**

### Three Pain Points (Icon + Text)

**⏰ Weeks of Waiting**
International background checks take 8-30 business days. Your project can't wait that long.

**💸 $200K Mis-Hire Risk**
38% of international resumes have unverifiable history. One bad hire costs $50K-$250K in delays and rework.

**🔒 Compliance Bottleneck**
Fintech and healthtech companies need KYC, AML, and background checks. Every contractor is a 3-week compliance project.

### Supporting Stat
"Our last contractor took 6 weeks to clear. The project deadline was 4 weeks away."
— CTO, Fintech Startup
